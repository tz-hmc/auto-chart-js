# Introduction
Auto-chart-js generates a reasonable looking rhythm game given a song uploaded in mp3 file format, using the fft.js library. Game can then be played with the web client.

# Installation & setup
1. npm install
2. On Windows, install [node-lame dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lame) following these instructions.
3. npm run serve
4. Browse to localhost:3333

# Next TODO items
1. Multiplayer with Websockets (done)
2. Input animations (done)
3. Generated chart playability (ongoing)
4. Small UX tweaks like spinner?

# Notes
Provided as a proof of concept & features may be missing, client side code is raw Web Components without a js framework.
