# Installation & setup
1. npm install
2. On Windows, install [node-lame dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lame) following these instructions.
3. npm run serve
4. Browse to localhost:3333

# Notes
Provided as a proof of concept & features may be missing, client side code is raw Web Components without a js framework.
