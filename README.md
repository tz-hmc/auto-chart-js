1. npm install
2. On Windows, install [node-lame dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lame) following these instructions.

4. Browse to localhost:3333

# Next TODO items 
1. Multiplayer with Websockets
2. Input animations

# Notes
Provided as a proof of concept & features may be missing, client side code is raw Web Components because the term "js framework" is limited to developer day job only.
